# FraudDetection_AWS_Sagemaker

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a scalable credit card fraud detection model using AWS SageMaker. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred over two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- AWS account with access to SageMaker and S3
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
- Visualize the results to understand the model's effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.
